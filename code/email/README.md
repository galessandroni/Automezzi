# Manual

Simple app to send an email. Fill all the form: *eMail*, *Subject* and *Text* and press *Send*. At this point you will redirect to your favourite email app which will send the mail as you have written.

Note: If you have a signature in your email account, this will be send with your email. It is possible using more than one signature: if the signature is a problem, simply add an empty signature.

When you will have send the mail, you can return to the app for sending another email.

This app was testing with *Gmail* and *Thunderbird* app.
