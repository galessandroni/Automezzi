# App description
The **Vehicles** app facilitates police work at a bureaucratic level.

When using a motor vehicle, various data must be returned
(such as Km travelled, fuel used, reason for service etc...) on a
paper document which will be, once completed,
police station.

Our app is used to speed up and digitize such
process.


In fact, you can fill out the form from your
mobile device and you can just as conveniently
Send it by e-mail to the police station to which you belong.

The application was conceived as a PCTO project and was developed by the students of the 3H class for the 2024/25 school year at the Liceo Marconi, applied sciences option.
