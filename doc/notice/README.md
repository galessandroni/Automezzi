## Credits

Ideas, vision, project coordination and authors (developers, graphics, legal team, documentation) are the pupils of 3H (school year 2024/2025) of Scientific Lyceum "Guglielmo Marconi", Pesaro, Italy.

In the third year we ask our pupils to develop their own project. In Italy, this activity is called Pathways for Transversal Skills and Orientation.

The only reason in the field _[authors](../../authors/README.md)_ is present only the teacher name is to protect the pupils, because this application will be used in thorny cases, as people under protection or transfer of detained. In this way, the pupils are listed in the _credit_ field, which has subsections according to the pupils' role.

## Third parties

At the end, we have a _[third parties](../../authors/Third_parties.md)_ section with several subsections where all icons, images, sounds and sources which are used for the creation of the application, even if not fully used. We have made the ethical choice to insert also the information labelled with citation not needed.
