## Terms and conditions

This software does not collect any of your data. It also does not use any cookies, trackers or similar for working. For this reason you don't need to sign any strange pacts with the devil or other obscured figure.

This application helps you to compile correctly the 106 form (that you have to send at your district). In this way the work is more environmentally friendly and sustainable, while also reducing the probability of mistakes.

## Credits

Ideas, vision, project coordination and authors (developers, graphics, legal team, documentation) are the pupils of 3H (school year 2024/2025) of Secondary School "Guglielmo Marconi", Pesaro, Italy.

In the third year we ask our pupils to develop their own project. In Italy, this activity is called "Percorsi per le Competenze Trasversali e per l'Orientamento" (Pathways for Transversal Skills and Orientation), usually abbreviated as "PCTO".

The only reason the field _[authors](../../authors/README.md)_ shows only the teacher's name is to protect the pupils, because this application will be used in thorny cases, such as people under protection or the transfer of detained individuals. This way, the pupils are listed in the _credit_ field, which has subsections according to the pupils' role.

## Third parties

At the end, we have a _[third parties](../../authors/Third_parties.md)_ section with several subsections where all icons, images, sounds and sources which are used for the creation of the application, even if not fully used. We have made the ethical choice to also insert the information labelled with citation not needed.
